## My process

In this challenge, I started by measuring the layout and identifying what section to be made. Then, I coded the sections in my HTML script. Last, I worked with the styling in CSS while tweaking the HTML for necessary changes. All done in vanilla HTML and CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned that the height of `<body>` element depends on its first content-containing descendant. I also learned that text elements can be very taxing, I needed to tweak some of the elements line-height and font-size to match the design example.

### Continued development

I'm considering to learn and use SCSS in my next work. I've tried using SCSS in my past work and I've found it helped me organizing my stylesheet.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools' articles on line-height](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_line-height.asp) - For my reference using line-height.
- [CSS-Tricks' articles on using SVG](https://css-tricks.com/using-svg/) - This helped me understanding how to work with SVG.
